## Getting Started

Welcome to `Localization Pro`, the dynamic localization solution for Flutter apps. This guide will help you integrate `Localization Pro` into your project effortlessly.

### Step 1: Add the package to your project

First, you need to add `Localization Pro` to your project. Insert the following line into your `pubspec.yaml` under the dependencies section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  localization_pro: ^x.y.z
```
### Step 2: Install the package
After updating your pubspec.yaml, run the following command to install the package:

``` yaml
flutter pub get
```
This command fetches the package and installs it into your project.

### Step 3: Import the package
Add the following import to the Dart files where you want to use the localization features:

```yaml
import 'package:localization_pro/localization_provider.dart';
```
# Usage

The `Localization Pro` package offers comprehensive localization functionalities. Below is a guide on how to utilize all features in your Flutter application.

## Setting Up Locales and Translations

First, define the locales your application will support along with the corresponding translation files. Here's an example of how to set up supported locales and their translations:

```dart
List<SupportedTranslation> supportedTranslations = [
  SupportedTranslation(name: '1', paths: {
    const Locale('en', 'US'): 'assets/locales/en_US/1.json',
    const Locale('uz', 'UZ'): 'assets/locales/uz_UZ/1.json',
  }),
  SupportedTranslation(name: '2', paths: {
    const Locale('en', 'US'): 'assets/locales/en_US/2.json',
    const Locale('uz', 'UZ'): 'assets/locales/uz_UZ/2.json',
  }),
  SupportedTranslation(name: '3', paths: {
    const Locale('en', 'US'): 'assets/locales/en_US/3.json',
    const Locale('uz', 'UZ'): 'assets/locales/uz_UZ/3.json',
  })
];

```

Ensure your JSON translation files are structured properly and stored at the specified paths.

## Initialization in Main

``` Dart

void main(){
  // Run the app and wrap MyApp with LocalizationProvider
  runApp(LocalizationProvider(
      supportedTranslations: supportedTranslations,
      initialLocale: const Locale('uz', 'UZ'),
      initialTranslations: ['1'],
      debugMode: true,
      child: MyApp()));
}

```

# Dynamic Translation Management
To dynamically add or remove translations during runtime, you can use methods provided by the LocalizationManager through the context. For instance:

## Adding a Translation
``` Dart
context.addTranslation('settings');
```
This would load the 'settings' translation for the current locale.

## Removing a Translation
``` Dart
context.removeTranslation('settings');
```
This would unload the 'settings' translation from the current locale.

## Changing Locale
Change the application's locale dynamically and reload the necessary translations:

``` Dart
context.changeLocale(Locale('es', 'ES'));
```
This switches the application's locale to Spanish and loads the appropriate translations.

## Translating Strings
Extend the String class to use translations easily in your UI code:
```Dart
Text('home_title'.tr())
```

### Translation with Parameters:
Suppose you have a translation entry that expects a name and a date. The JSON might look like this:

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello, {name}! Today is {date}."
}
```

#### Using trParams in Code:
You can use the trParams method to insert dynamic values into this translation:

``` dart
String greeting = 'greeting'.trParams({
  'name': 'Alice',
  'date': 'April 4th'
});
Text(greeting); // Displays: "Hello, Alice! Today is April 4th."
```

### `trPlural` Function
The `trPlural` function is used to translate text keys into their appropriate plural forms based on the given count. This function is essential for handling pluralization in different locales.

#### Parameters:
- `count`: The number used to determine the plural form of the translation.
- `context`: (Optional) The build context from which the locale is resolved. This is used to access the correct localized data.

#### Usage:

```dart
// Usage of trPlural in a Text widget for singular or plural forms based on the count.
String singleOrPlural = trPlural(1);
Text(singleOrPlural); // Displays 'item' if count is 1 or 'items' if more

// Example in a full sentence where count influences the translation
int itemCount = 3;
Text(trPlural(itemCount) + ' remaining in your cart'); // Could translate to '3 items remaining in your cart'

```


### `tr` Function
The `tr` function is designed to translate text keys into localized strings based on the current locale settings. It supports basic translation, context-based translation, dynamic string formatting with named arguments, and pluralization. This function is ideal for integrating localization directly within UI components like `Text` widgets.

#### Parameters:
- `key`: The key corresponding to the text that needs to be translated.
- `context`: (Optional) The build context from which the locale is resolved.
- `namedArgs`: (Optional) A map of named arguments used for string formatting within the translation.
- `count`: (Optional) An integer used for handling plural forms in translations.

#### Usage in `Text` Widget:

```dart
// Basic translation directly in a Text widget
Text(tr('hello'))

// Translation with context in a Text widget
Text(tr('hello', context: context))

// Translation with named arguments in a Text widget
Text(tr('welcome', namedArgs: {'name': 'Alice'}))

// Translation with pluralization in a Text widget
Text(tr('cats', count: 5))

// Combined named arguments and pluralization in a Text widget
// Useful for complex translations involving both dynamic data and plural forms.
Text(tr('party_invitation', namedArgs: {'name': 'Alice', 'numberOfGuests': '5'}, count: 5))

```


### Documentation for Handling Nested JSON Translations

#### Purpose:
Handling nested JSON structures allows your localization system to manage complex translation entries organized in a hierarchical manner.
#### Usage:

#### Nested JSON Example:
Your JSON file might contain nested keys like so:

``` json
{
  "settings": {
    "audio": {
      "volume": "Volume",
      "balance": "Balance"
    },
    "display": {
      "brightness": "Brightness",
      "contrast": "Contrast"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Fetching a Nested Translation:
Access the nested translation using dot notation:

``` dart

Text('settings.audio.volume'.tr()); // Displays: "Volume"
```
